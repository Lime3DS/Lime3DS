**Azahar** is a free and open-source high level Nintendo 3DS emulator for PC and mobile devices. Our goal is to give 3DS owners a place to enjoy their library of titles with improvements to the original hardware, such as higher resolutions, modern controllers or save states. The emulator also serves as a debugging hub for homebrew developers and as a research and preservation platform for the 3DS ecosystem.

The project continues the legacy of **Citra** and is actively developed by a community of contributors.

*Azahar is not affiliated with or endorsed by Nintendo.*

# Installation

### Windows

Azahar is available as both an installer and a zip archive.

Download the latest release in your preferred format from the [Releases](https://github.com/azahar-emu/azahar/releases) page.

If you are unsure of whether you want to use MSVC or MSYS2, use MSYS2.

---

### MacOS

To download a build that will work on all Macs, you can download the `macos-universal` build on the [Releases](https://github.com/azahar-emu/azahar/releases) page.

Alternatively, if you wish to download a build specifically for your Mac, you can choose either:

- `macos-arm64` for Apple Silicon Macs
- `macos-x86_64` for Intel Macs

---

### Android

There are two variants of Azahar available on Android, those being the Vanilla and Google Play builds.

The Vanilla build is technically superior, as it uses an alternative method of file management which is faster, but isn't permitted on the Google Play store.

For most users, we currently recommended downloading Azahar on Android via the Google Play Store for ease of accessibility:

<a href='https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.github.lime3ds.android'><img width='180' alt='Get it on Google Play' src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pioug/google-play-badges/06ccd9252af1501613da2ca28eaffe31307a4e6d/svg/English.svg'/></a>

Alternatively, you can install the app using Obtainium, allowing you to use the Vanilla variant:
1. Download and install Obtainium from [here](https://github.com/ImranR98/Obtainium/releases) (use the file named `app-release.apk`)
2. Open Obtainium and click 'Add App'
3. Type `https://github.com/azahar-emu/azahar` into the 'App Source URL' section
4. Click 'Add'
5. Click 'Install', and select the preferred variant

If you wish, you can also simply install the latest APK from the [Releases](https://github.com/azahar-emu/azahar/releases) page.

Keep in mind that you will not recieve automatic updates when installing via the APK.

### Linux

The recommended format for using Azahar on Linux is the Flatpak available on Flathub:

<a href='https://flathub.org/apps/org.azahar_emu.Azahar'><img width='180' alt='Download on Flathub' src='https://dl.flathub.org/assets/badges/flathub-badge-en.png'/></a>

Azahar is also available as an AppImage on the [Releases](https://github.com/azahar-emu/azahar/releases) page.

There are two variants of the AppImage available, those being `azahar.AppImage` and `azahar-wayland.AppImage`.

If you are unsure of which variant to use, we recommend using the default `azahar.AppImage`. This is because of upstream issues in the Wayland ecosystem which may cause problems when running the emulator (e.g. [#1162](https://github.com/azahar-emu/azahar/issues/1162)).

Unless you explicitly require native Wayland support (e.g. you are running a system with no Xwayland), the non-Wayland variant is recommended.

The Flatpak build of Azahar also has native Wayland support disabled by default. If you require native Wayland support, it can be enabled using [Flatseal](https://flathub.org/en/apps/com.github.tchx84.Flatseal).

# How can I contribute?

### Pull requests

If you want to implement a change and have the technical capability to do so, we would be happy to accept your contributions.

If you are contributing a new feature, it is highly suggested that you first make a Feature Request issue to discuss the addition before writing any code. This is to ensure that your time isn't wasted working on a feature which isn't deemed appropriate for the project.

After creating a pull request, please don't repeatedly merge `master` into your branch. A maintainer will update the branch for you if/ when it is appropriate to do so.

### Language translations

Additionally, we are accepting language translations on [Transifex](https://app.transifex.com/azahar/azahar). If you know a non-english language listed on our Transifex page, please feel free to contribute.

> [!NOTE]
> We are not currently accepting new languages for translation. Please do not request for new languages or language variants to be added.

### Compatibility reports

Even if you don't wish to contribute code or translations, you can help the project by reporting game compatibility data to our compatibility list.

To do so, simply read https://github.com/azahar-emu/compatibility-list/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md and follow the instructions.

Contributing compatibility data helps more accurately reflect the current capabilities of the emulator, so it would be highly appreciated if you could go through the reporting process after completing a game.
